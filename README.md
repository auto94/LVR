# LongVideoRecorder

This is an app that will, when completed, enable the user to record videos at different fps/resolution and therefore enable you to record longer videos without filling up all the storage space on your phone.
It is currently early in production and will take a while to complete.

## Current stage in development:
-> Starting work on implementing the recording.

-> 2nd stage of UI development COMPLETE:
